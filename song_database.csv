For Baltimore - All Time Low,medium,alternative rock,happy,2010s,"[Intro]
Mayday, situation overload
I'm restless, obsessed with your future
And all my worries they don't bother you
Collected, you render me useless
But I carry on

[Verse 1]
Right now, I think that you think that I'm
Half drunk, searching for something of
Substance, casually dropping a line, designed
To keep you next to me
I can't awkwardly craft in advance
I know that you wouldn't fall for that
You say ""Shut up and take my hand""
And we carry on

[Chorus]
I don't wanna say goodnight
The city comes alive, when we're together
Why can't Thursday last forever?
I don't wanna say goodnight
I've never been so sure
Just do it for the memories
Do it for Baltimore
And do it for me


[Verse 2]
Hot damn, look at me now
I'm all caught up riding the high of my
Good luck, casually dropping a line, designed
To keep you next to me
I bet you never thought you would fall again
So much for keeping this just friends
Shut up and kiss me now
And we carry on

[Chorus]
I don't wanna say goodnight
The city comes alive, when we're together
Why can't Thursday last forever?
I don't wanna say goodnight
I've never been so sure
Just do it for the memories
Do it for Baltimore
And do it for me
(Do it for me)

Memory - Sugarcult,fast,alternative rock,happy,2000s,"This may never start
We could fall apart
And I'd be your memory
Lost your sense of fear
Feelings insincere
Can I be your memory?

So get back, back, back to where we lasted
Just like I imagine
I could never feel this way
So get back, back, back to the disaster
My heart's beating faster
Holding on to feel the same

This may never start
I'll tear us apart
Can I be your enemy?
Losing half a year
Waiting for you here
I'd be your anything

Get back, back, back to where we lasted
Just like I imagine
I could never feel this way
Get back, back, back to the disaster

Tearing out my heart

I tried to be perfect
But nothing was worth it
I don’t believe it makes me real
I thought it’d be easy
But no one believes me
I meant all the things I said

[Chorus]
If you believe it’s in my soul
I’d say all the words that I know
Just to see if it would show
That I’m trying to let you know
That I’m better off on my own

This place is so empty
My thoughts are so tempting
I don’t know how it got so bad
Sometimes it’s so crazy
That nothing can save me
But it’s the only thing that I have

What Are You So Scared Of? - Tonight Alive,medium,alternative rock,happy,2000s,"[Verse 1]
Well it's a sad truth, living with these hungry hands
It's a shame, we don't know how much we have
We're scared of what we do not know
No matter where we wanna go
We wait for it, to find you, to find you
But the truth is far behind you now
Time to say it out loud:

What are you so scared of?
Judgements not unfair
It's what we've learned to see
What are you afraid of?
This is not unheard of
Nothing's how it wasn't always meant to be
Always meant to be

And you can go on thinking that you're so hard done by
And don't pretend you've worked so hard, just scraping by
It's not a crime to see the light
It doesn't mean you sleep better at night
It's not a crime to wear a smile

But now you need time to clear your mind
You're tripping over what is wrong and right

Think back, think back, to the summertime

With my electric heart I then will find
A way through all these damn street signs

December - Neck Deep,slow,alternative rock,sad,2010s,"[Verse 1]
Stumbled 'round the block a thousand times
You missed every call that I had tried
So now I'm giving up
A heartbreak in mid-December
You don't give a fuck
You never remember me
While you're pulling on his jeans
Getting lost in the big city
I was looking out our window
Watching all the cars go
Wondering if I'll see Chicago
Or a sunset on the West Coast
Or will I die in the cold?
Feeling blue and alone
I wonder if you'll ever hear this song on your stereo

I hope you get your ball room floor
Your perfect house with rose red doors
I'm the last thing you'd remember
It's been a long, lonely December
I wish I'd known that less is more
But I was passed out on the floor
That's the last thing I remember
It's been a long, lonely December

Cast me aside to show yourself in a better light
I came out grieving, barely breathing and you came out alright
But I'm sure you'll take his hand
I hope he's better than I ever could have been

Pain is never permanent but tonight it's killing me

"If You Wanted A Song Written About You, All You Had To Do Was Ask - Mayday Parade",medium,alternative rock,sad,2000s,"I'm throwing away pictures
That I never should have taken in the first place
And it's cold in my apartment
As I'm changing all the colors
From the brightest reds to grays

Well it's 3 o'clock on monday morning
I'm just hoping you're not seeing his face
I've been getting calls in these hotel rooms
Long enough to know that it was him
That took my place

And I hope this makes you happy now
That the flame we had is burning out
And I hope you like your pictures facing down
As even broken hearts may have their doubts

And I'm burning all the letters
Hoping that I might forget her and the bad taste
That she left when she was leaving me
A life of barely breathing as she walked
Out of this place

And you dropped the note and we changed key
You changed yourself and I changed me
I really didn't see us singing through this
Then you screamed the bridge
And I cried the verse
And our chorus came out unrehearsed
And you smiled the whole way through it
I guess maybe that's what's worse


And I hope this makes you happy now
That the flame we had is burning out
And I hope you like your pictures facing down
As even broken hearts may have their doubts

And I'm taking all your memories off the shelf
And I don't need you or anybody else
So take a look at me

"From Time -  Drake, Jhene Aiko",slow,hip-hop/rap,sad,2010s,"What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that, I'd never make you feel like that
'Cause I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you've been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love
Yeah I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I can take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking a lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
Y'all don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love
Uh, thinking 'bout Texas back when Porsche used to work at Treasures
Or further back then that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we talked about something we disagreed on
Then she started telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in a galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks to the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without trying to prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I thought we had it all planned out, guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living I just hope I'm forgiven
It seems like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for, who better for you than the boy, huh?
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

Fulfilled, listen even back when we was broke my team ill

Talk to a nigga
One time for my LA sisters
One time for my LA hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who knows
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
No role models and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory
I couldn't find one

By the baddest bitch, not Trina, but I swear to God
This bitch will make you call your girl up and tell her ""Hey, what's good?
""Sorry I'm never comin' home I'ma stay for good""
Then hang the phone up, and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said ""Nah, I was the same without it""
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
Before I started callin' bitches bitches so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody

I Won't - Big L,fast,hip-hop/rap,angry,1990s,"Aiiyyo, some people was born in heaven
With a silver spoon in they mouth
And had everything handed to them on a silver platter
And never had to work hard for nothing

Then there are some people that was born in the opposite world
Of those that was born in heaven, which is called hell
And had to work hard for everything they got
And never had nothing handed to them... and never will I'm only at the age of 10
And life already seems to me like it's heading for a dead end
Cause my moms be smoking mad crack
My dad went out for a fast snack, and never brought his ass back
Nobody knows how I feel, it's quite ill
Cause I had to steal to fill my stomach with a nice meal
Too ashamed to walk the streets
Wearing the same cheap sneaks and dirty outfits for weeks
Even my holidays got damaged
Cause on Christmas I asked Santa for a father and a hot sandwich
I just can't take it (uh-huh, uh-huh)
And every day I ask myself, 'how will I make it?' It seems like my life's been cursed
Ever since I was a child, and how will I make it?
I won't, that's how
I walk around with a frown; I got no reason to smile
And how will I make it?
I won't, that's how
Aiiyyo times was rough, I had to grow up foul
And how will I make it?
I won't, that's how
I always knew that I'd end up doing time on the Isle
And how will I make it?
I won't, that's how  Five years passed by, now I'm at the age of 15
No more fun and games, it's time to get cream (word up)
Cause I'm about to burst, it's like my life was cursed
I went to church, prayed everyday
And it still got worse
Soon I ran into a couple of guns
Started stalking the streets, slate robbing suckers for funds (give it up, give it up)
Now everyday I creep with the heat
Ain't nothing sweet, I rob for meat
If I don't steal I don't eat
Then I lost control and started going too far
Robbed this brother named Umar
Then got snatched by the blue car
Where I grew up it was a living hell
Then I started to realize – I'm better off in a prison cell
Now I can sleep, now I can eat
Can't hit skins, but I wasn't hitting skins when I was in the street
Aiiyyo I just can't take it
And every day I ask myself, 'how will I make it?'  Doing time was full of stress G, all the
Fighting's and stabbings and men finding men sexy
One tried to test me didn't find it humorous
Beat him with a pillowcase filled with cans of tuna fish
My time came to a cease; I'm back on the streets again
I hope I don't get snatched by the beast again
But it's getting crazy hectic
Cause I'm broke, get up naked
And can't get a job cause of my jail record
Before you know it, I was robbing them same ducks
I even started robbing homeless folks for they change cups
My whole life was deserted
Either I'ma go back to jail or get murdered, but do I deserve it?
All I tried to do was live the one life that I got
But it seems like I can't get a fair shot (word up)
I just can't take it (uh-huh)

She told me, ""Watch the snakes cause they watching you""
I told her, ""Aw baby don't start!
I ain't looking for the way to your heart!""
She said, ""You bout to miss church"" while she riding me
I like my sundaes with a cherry on top

This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with
A little Fayettenam nigga out in Beverly Hills
That's when I ran into this chick I went to college with
Yeah back when a nigga was on scholarship
Was in a rush but I still stopped to holla, shit
That's the least I owed her cause I tried to hit
On the first night, nah I ain't proud of it
I boned her in my dorm room and kicked her out of it
And I never called back, how thoughtfuless
Now I'm standing in the streets tryna politic with her
In her mind she calling me a misogynist nigga
On some Bobby Brown shit my prerogative
Nigga is to hit and never commit
Now realizing when I hit she never forgets
So every time I ignore the telephone call
Saying I'll hit her back knowing I'm never gon' call
She was hurting
Now she staring dead in my face she was smirking
Like, ""Yeah I remember and nah you ain't worth shit, nigga
You ain't worth shit, nigga""
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with",any

'Cause what if it's not reciprocated?""
I told her, ""Don't rush girl, don't you rush
Guess it's all a game of patience""
She said, ""What if I dive deep?
Will you come in after me?
Would you share your flaws with me? Let me know""

Love will happen when it wants
I know it hurts sometimes, but don't let it go""

Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food
Pass the plate! Where my drink? This my day, lucky you
Fuck you too, woah!
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice
Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you all and you're finished
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin'
You mighta went platinum, but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told them the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time
I ain't no gangster, but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of knives
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My twelve days of Christmas was nothin' but lies
I, run at you hard like a sumo (sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (chulo)
I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno
Bitch I'm a dog, call me Cujo
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw four like a Uno
Cállate boca mejor maricón little puto, and all of you culo
They debated the level, I've been to ghetto to ghetto
Looking for something I prolly could never find now
Shit get real up until the beef die down
In truth a nigga just really want me tied down
I've been alone, and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke
When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope
You in the wrong cab down the wrong path
Nigga wrong way, wrong road
Snakes in the grass, tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower
I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em
Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference?
I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
Man I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I been eatin' long enough, man my stomach should be full
I just ate, lick the plate, my buffet, lucky me
Fuck you think? (Woo!)
I got a couple of mansions
Still I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghost writers
But to these kids it don't actually matter
They're askin' me ""What the fuck happened to hip-hop?""
I said ""I don't have any answers""
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
And actually coming from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say ""What a wonderful feeling!""
We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me, the inability to pin humility
Hatata batata, why don't we make a bunch of fuckin'
Songs about nothin' and mumble!
And fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap, let's recap
Way back, MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks
ADATs, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP, and bring Masta Ace back
Because half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact, where the old me at? The same cat that would take that
Feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable
They know what button to press or what lever to pull
To get me the snap though (lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention I'm probably makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' the dicks
In the fuckin' back, ho (get it?)
On the brink, any minute
Got me thinkin' of finishin' everything
With acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
Of another beat, I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine
With the minithin, it better be at least 70 to 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I wrote 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for
Like California wishin' rain would pour
And that drought y'all have been prayin' for
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboy
So y'all gotta move (yeah), y'all gotta move (yeah), y'all gotta move

I blow the smoke from the car exhaust
Flying to a party I am not invited to, feeling like the streets need me (whoa)
I ain't gotta dance as long as my Ferrari Spider move, like C Breezy
I don't gotta hire goons, I'd rather try to buy the moon, and breathe freely
The sky is blue, the tie is new, the Masarati white and cool like G-Eazy
While these dudes tryna figure out how to do a freestyle as fly as me
I'm confused trying to figure out how to do Kapri Styles and Mya G
Everybody doing chick joints, probably rob these little dudes at fist point
Remember everybody used to bite Nickel, now everybody doing Bitcoin

If the cops hit us up, we can flush the shit down
We can not give a fuck, shit, a fucking colonic
Selling your cock and your butt for a follower
Possible cup, for dollars you powder sniff
Now you're slipping, call it a power trip
A product of politics
Y'all went from profit and topping the charts
To dropped in the park in a pile of shit
Knowledge is power, but powerless if you got it and you do not acknowledge it
Y'all music sound like Dr. Seuss inspired it
Hiring strippers, prostitutes retiring

Of sick individuals, take my dick and put the tip in
At minimal, I'm fucking these syllables
I let them lick on my genitals
I'm a fucking invisible, indefensible, despicable difficult prick, a little bit unpredictable
I spit the formidable, that you're bitches are fucking with the original
I can say that me and Nickel are identical

"Regulate - Warren G, Nate Dogg",medium,hip-hop/rap,angry,1990s,"It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G. is on the streets, trying to consume
Some skirts for the eve, so I can get some funk
Just rollin' in my ride, chillin all alone
Just hit the eatside of the L.B.C.
On a mission trying to find Mr. Warren G.
Seen a car full of skirts ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213
So I hooks a left on the 21 to Lewis
Some brothas shootin dice so I said ""let's do this""
I jumped out the ride, and said""what's up?""
Some brothas pulled some gats so I said ""I'm stuck""
Since these girls peepin me I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin so hard they straight hit the curb
Gonna think of better things than some horny tricks
I see my homey and some suckers all in his mix
I'm gettin jacked, I'm breakin myself
I can't believe they're taking Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my rolex
I looked at the brothas and said ""damn, what's next?""
They got my homey hemmed up and they all around
Ain't none of them seeing if they going straight pound for pound
I gotta come up real quick before they start to clown
I besta pull out my strap and lay them busters down
They got guns to my head
I think I'm going down
I can't believe this happened in my home town
If I had wings I would fly
Let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homey Nate
Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin and yellin
It's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G. had to regulate
I laid all them busters down
I let my gat explode
Now I'm switching my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts step back and observe
I just left a gang of those over there on the curb
Now Nate got the freaks
And that's a known fact
Before I got jacked I was on the same track
Back up back up 'cause it's on
N-A-T-E and me
The Warren to the G
Just like I thought
They were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help
The Nate Dogg and the G-child
Were in need of something else
One of them dames was sexy as hell
I said ""ooh I like your size""
She said ""my car's broke down and you seem real nice, ""
""would you let me ride?""
I got a car full of girls and it's going real swell
The next stop is the east side motel
I'm tweaking
Onto a whole new level
G-Funk
Stept towards
I dare ya
Funk
On a whole new level
The rythmn is the base and the base is the treble
Chords
Strings
We brings
Melody
G-Funk
Where rythmn is life
And life is rythmn

Safe to say I paved the way
For you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wastin' days away
Now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protege
Homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein' gracious
They violate in a major way
I never been a hater
Still I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay'
You know they couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black and white
It has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway
Even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way
Not move away 'cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood
And all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience
But they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray
Now I could make 'em put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life
Can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away

Could do without the fame
And rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin' and the hollerin'

Where you from, who you know
What you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight
Of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into your bank account
And you up out of poverty
Your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches
'Cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?

Everywhere you go;
Take a look at the five and ten

With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

Yeah, I'm on the drum, yeah, I'm on the snare drum
Yeah, I'm on the beat 'cause the beat goes dumb
And I only spit heat 'cause I'm playing for the Son
Playing for the king, playing for the title
I'm surprised you didn't hear this in the Bible
I'm so tight I might go psycho

I'm so bad like Michael, I know
I'm still young, but I go, I go
Stupid, stupid, love like Cupid
I'm the drummer boy, so do it, do it

Yo, at the table with the family, havin' dinner
BlackBerry on our hip and then it gave a little flicker
Then I took a look to see before it activates the ringer
Came to realize my homie Bieber hit me on the Twitter
Then I hit him back despite I had some food up on my fingers
Sippin' eggnog, with a little sprinkle of vanilla
Even though it's kinda cold, I'm pullin' out a chinchilla
Bieber hit me back and said ""Let's make it hot up in the winter"", I said ""Cool""
You know I'mma deliver
Let's collaborate and make the holiday a little bigger
Before we work, I gotta get this off
See the other family members and drop gifts off
Then I'm headed to the studio 'cause ain't nothing stopping how
You know we 'bout to turn it up and really get it popping now
People everywhere and all our Twitter followers
Merry Christmas, Kwanza, Happy Hanukkah

If you wanna give, it's the time of year
JB on the beat, yeah, yeah, I'm on the snare
It's crazy how some people say they, say they don't care
When there's people on the street with no food, it's not fair
It's about time for you to act merrily
It's about time for you to give to charity
Rarely do people even wanna help at all
'Cause they're warm by the fire getting toys and their dolls
Not thinkin' there's a family out hungry and cold
Wishin', wishin' that they had somebody they could hold
So I think some of you need to act bold
Give a can to a drive, let's change the globe, globe, globe, globe, globe

So very nice - I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
My mother will start to worry - Beautiful, what's your hurry
My father will be pacing the floor - Listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry - Beautiful, please don't hurry
Well maybe just a half a drink more - Put some music on while I pour
The neighbors might think - Baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink - No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how - Your eyes are like starlight now
To break this spell - I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
I ought to say no, no, no, sir - Mind if I move a little closer
At least I'm gonna say that I tried - What's the sense in hurting my pride
I really can't stay - Baby don't hold out
Ahh, but it's cold outside
C'mon baby
I simply must go - Baby, it's cold outside
The answer is no - Oooh baby, it's cold outside
This welcome has ben - I'm lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm -- Look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious - Man, your lips look so delicious
My brother will be there at the door - Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious - Gosh your lips look delicious
Well maybe just a half a drink more - Never such a blizzard before
I've got to go home - Oh, baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me your coat - It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand - Your eyes are like starlight now
But don't you see - How can you do this thing to me
There's bound to be talk tomorrow - Making my life long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied - If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay - Get over that old out
Ahh, but it's cold outside
Baby it's cold outside
Brr it's cold....
It's cold out there
Can't you stay a while longer baby

""Bah, humbug""
No, that's too strong
Cause it is my favorite holiday
But all this year's been a busy blur
Don't think I have the energy

To add to my already mad rush
Just cause it's 'tis the season
The perfect gift for me would be
Completions and connections left from

Last year, ski shop
Encounter, most interesting
Had his number but never the time
Most of '81 passed along those lines

So deck those halls, trim those trees
Raise up cups of Christmas cheer
I just need to catch my breath
Christmas by myself this year

Calendar pictures, frozen landscape
Chilled this room for twenty-four days
Evergreens, sparkling snow
Get this winter over with


Flashback to springtime, saw him again
Would've been good to go for lunch
Couldn't agree when we were both free
We tried, we said we'd keep in touch

Didn't, of course, 'til summertime
Out to the beach to his boat could I join him?
No, this time it was me
Sunburn in the third degree

Now the calendar's just one page
Of course, I am excited
Tonight's the night, but I've set my mind
Not to do too much about it

With the world's smallest turkey
Already in the oven, nice and hot
Oh damn, guess what I forgot?


So on with the boots, back out in the snow
To the only all-night grocery
When what to my wandering eyes should appear
In the line is that guy I've been chasing all year

""I'm spending this one alone"" he said
""Need a break, this year's been crazy""
I said ""Me too, but why are you?
You mean you forgot cranberries too?""

Then suddenly we laughed and laughed
Caught on to what was happening
That Christmas magic's brought this tale
To a very happy ending!

Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer had a very shiny nose

I tear apart the pages of the story of my life
In black and white, the wrong and right
Will struggle to survive

[Chorus]
And I've been falling apart in the pouring rain
I'm waging war on myself
A captive casualty
Traded a merciful heart for a murderer's brain
But now I curse what's in my head
Because I can't stop seeing red

[Verse 1]
Did you really think I would falter my friend?
I've destroyed you before I'll destroy you again
I'm the hell that is your future
I'll incinerate your past
I'm the devil on your shoulder
But I'll always be your better half
We might share one body
But this spine is fucking mine
By now you should know
You're just a spectator, I'm the show
Is this the end of me?

Traded a merciful heart for a murderer's brain

Did you really think you could Hyde from me, doctor?
Have you not seen the legacy I've carved into the flesh of this city?

An artist of infection and you're just another piece in my collection
A mirror image of perfection
Who's time has fucking come

Streetlights filter through my blinds
Knowing life's a real short time
And now I shake the hands of all my old enemies
I ignore the threat of their disease

Hotel California - Eagles,medium,rock,happy,1970s,"[Verse 1: Don Henley]
On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
""This could be Heaven or this could be Hell""
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

[Chorus: Don Henley]
""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (Any time of year)
You can find it here""

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
She got the Mercedes Benz
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
She calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain
""Please bring me my wine""
He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here since 1969""
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They living it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)

Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said: ""We are all just prisoners here
Of our own device""
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast
Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before

""We are programmed to receive

But you can never leave!""

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd

Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles

And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone

This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say ""Yes""

Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading

Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come

We were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns a-starin'
Out the window at the darkness

And he began to speak
He said, ""Son, I've made a life
Out of readin' people's faces
Knowin' what the cards were
By the way they held their eyes
So if you don't mind me sayin'
I can see you're out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey
I'll give you some advice""

And asked me for a light
And the night got deathly quiet
And his faced lost all expression
He said, ""If you're gonna play the game, boy

Something Like That - Tim McGraw,fast,country,happy,1990s,"It was Labor Day weekend I was seventeen
I bought a Coke and some gasoline
And I drove out to the county fair
When I saw her for the first time
She was standing there in the ticket line
And it all started right then and there
Oh, a sailer's sky made a perfect sunset
And that's the day I'll never forget

I had a barbeque stain on my white tee shirt
She was killing me in that miniskirt
Skippin' rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
She had a suntan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
And a heart don't forget something like that

Well it was five years later on a southbound plane
I was headed down to New Orleans
To meet some friends of mine for Mardi Gras
When I heard a voice from the past
Comin' from a few rows back
And when I looked, I couldn't believe just what I saw
She said I bet you don't remember me
And I said only every other memory

I had a barbeque stain on my white tee shirt
You were killing me in that miniskirt
Skippin' rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
You had a suntan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
And a heart don't forget something like that

Like an old photograph
Time can make a feeling fade
But the memory of a first love
Never fades away

I had a barbecue stain on my white tee shirt
She was killing me in that miniskirt
Skippin’ rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
She had a sun tan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
A heart don’t forget, no a heart don’t forget
I said a heart don’t forget something like that
Oh, not something like that",any

Record Year- Eric Church,slow,country,sad,2010s,"Since you turned the tables on me
I've been steady and learnin' lonely
Keepin' this turntable spinnin'
Everything from Jones to Jennings
Slowly plannin' my survival
In a three-foot stack of vinyl
Since you had to walk on outta here
I've been havin' a record year

I bet you thought before you left
I'd just sit in silence by myself
Turn this house into a jail
Dyin' slow in a livin' hell
But love's got a funny way of keepin' score
And your leavin' lit up my scoreboard
I usually make it through side A sober
All bets are off when I flip her over
One bourbon, one scotch, one beer
I'm havin' a record year

Quarter notes and Hank's half time
Are poundin' on this heart of mine
Song to song, I pass my time
With these speakers on ten
Your good-and-gone keeps me up all night
Along with Songs In The Key Of Life
I'm either gonna get over you
Or I'm gonna blow out my ears
Yeah, you're out there now
Doin' God knows how, and I'm stuck here
Havin' a record year

Your leavin' left me goin' crazy
I'm countin' on a needle to save me
I drop it in the groove
And we go 'round and 'round
And down in a spiral
I guess I really oughta call and thank you
I rediscovered Red Headed Stranger
Got down with old James Brown
And found New Grass Revival
If you find your way back, I owe you a beer
For my record year

One of the best nights
That I've had no doubt
Between the bottle of wine
And the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain

And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love

If I never get to see the Northern lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man

Happy man, baby
Mmm

Baby, that red dress brings me to my knees
Oh, but that black dress makes it hard to breathe
You're a saint, you're a Goddess,
The cutest, the hottest,
A masterpiece
It's too good to be true,
Nothing better than you
In my wildest dreams

No fancy destination

Listen to the radio
Or dance around the fireplace

And if I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
Or drive a sports car up the coast of California

Talladega - Eric Church,medium,country,happy,2010s,"It was the summer before the real world started and,
The deal was we would get to go, if we
Cleaned it up, and got it running,
Daddy's old Winnebago.

Wing and a prayer down 65,
Five best friends on four bald tires,
I can still see Billy smiling
When we finally made it.

To Talladega, boys raise the
Whiskey in your glass, here's to turn it up,
Slowing down and cars that go real fast,

We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing,
And thinking as that checkered flag was waving,
Sure would like to stay in, Talladega.

Like a stone, time rolls on,
You can't hit pause, that's just the deal,
Most days in life don't stand out,
But life's about those days that will, like,

Rockin' Randall, gettin' rowdy,
Shooting roman candles at the man in the moon,
'Til the Alabama sun was breaking

Over Talladega, boys raise the
Whiskey in your glass, here's to turn it up,
Slowing down and cars that go real fast,

We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing,
And thinking as that checkered flag was waving,
Sure would like to stay in, Talladega.

When the winds grow cold and it blows October,
I think about us shoulder to shoulder,
Like those cars, my thoughts roll over and over and over,
In my mind

Tonight I'm in Talladega, boys raise the
Whiskey in your glass, here's to turn it up,
Slowing down and cars that go real fast,

We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing,
And thinking as that checkered flag was waving,
Sure would like to stay in, Talladega.

Play It Again - Luke Bryan,medium,country,happy,2010s,"She was sittin' all alone over on the tailgate
Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate
I was lookin' for her boyfriend,
Thinkin', ""No way she ain't got one.""
Soon as I sat down I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off

She was like, ""Oh, my God, this is my song.
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long.
Sittin' 'round, waitin' for it to come on and here it is.""
She was like, ""Come here boy, I wanna dance.""
'Fore I said a word she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around 'til it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again.""
And I said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again.""

I'd gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later we were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool AM, FM, XM, too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up

She was like, ""Oh, my God, this is my song.
We've been listenin' to the radio all night long.
I can't believe that it came back on, but here it is.""
She was like, ""Come here boy, I wanna dance.""
'Fore I said a word she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And I said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again.""
And she said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again.""

The next Friday night
We were sittin' out under the stars
You should have seen her smile
When I broke out my guitar

She was like, ""Oh my God, this is my song.
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long.
Sittin' 'round, waitin' for it to come on and here it is.""
She was like, ""Come here boy, I wanna dance.""

We locked eyes
Over whiskey on ice

Driving us to your house

Bitching and moaning on and on 'bout the time I had
And by Tuesday, you could say that girl was good as gone
And then when Thursday came around, I was all alone

So I went for a drive to clear my mind, ended up at a Shell on I-65

Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch off ticket
Bought two twelve packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time, oh, but she was wrong
I was caller number 5 on the radio station
Won a 4-day, 3-night beach vacation
Deep sea, senorita, fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my ex future mother-in-law anymore
Oh, Lord, when it rains it pours

Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize
When she heard about my new found luck on that FM dial
And it's crazy how lately now it just seems to come in waves
What I thought was gonna be the death of me was my saving grace

It's got me thinking that her leaving is the only logical reason

That I got the last spot in the Hooter's parking lot
And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart
She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call
And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club Raffle
Won a used four-wheeler and three free passes
For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf
And I ain't gotta see my ex future mother-in-law anymore
Oh, Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours

I've been on one hell of a redneck roll for three weeks now
And it all started on the day that she walked out

Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch off ticket
Bought two twelve packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time, oh, but she was wrong
And I was caller number 5 on the radio station
Won a 4-day, 3-night beach vacation

Greatest Love Story - LANCO,slow,country,happy,2010s,"They said I was nothing but a trouble maker never up to no good
You were the perfect all American girl wouldn't touch me even if you could
But you were sneaking out your window every night riding shotgun in my car
We'd go to the river and find us a spot and we probably went a little too far
Just a little too far

Cause I was gonna be your forever and
You were gonna be my wife
We didn't know any better
Didn't have a clue about life
But I was what you wanted you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen

So you went off to college and I got a job I was working at a 9 to 5
Dreaming of the days when you were in my arms I'd never felt so alive
I'd spend my days working, spend my nights drinking, howling at the moon
Screaming for the days when you were coming back no couldn't come too soon
Couldn't come too soon

When I was gonna be your forever
You were gonna be my wife
But you went off to find better
And I was learning all about life
But I was what you wanted and you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen

So you came back after a long four years
Your college boyfriend didn't work out
So we went out for a couple of drinks to find out who we are now
Sure we changed but way deep down you had the same old feelings for me
I went to the store and bought you a ring and I got down on one knee
Down on one knee

And I said
I'm gonna be your forever
So baby will you be my wife
Now that we know a little better
We could have a real nice life
Cause I'm what you wanted and you're what I need
So let's meet in between
We are gonna be the greatest love story this town has ever seen
We are gonna be the greatest love story this world has ever seen
So baby say yes to me

I still ask you what you're drinking, what's your name

I'll introduce you to my mom and dad
Say ""I think I love her"" when you leave that room
I'd still not take their advice when I say you're moving in

Even if I knew you'd be the one that got away
I'd still go back and get you
Even if I knew you'd be my best and worst mistake
Oh, I'd still make it with you
Over and over, again and again
Even though we break up in the end

I'd still play my favorite song in your car
Let you love me to it, 'til it felt like ours
Now all I hear is you in it, but I'd still let you ruin it

You don't know her like I do

I can't forget, I'm drowning in these memories
It fills my soul with all the little things
And I can't cope, it's like a death inside the family
It's like she stole my way to breathe
So don't try to tell me I'll stop hurting
And don't try to tell me she ain't worth it

On my grandpa's farm
I was thirsting for knowledge 
And he had a car
Yeah, I was caught somewhere between a woman and a child
One restless summer we found love growing wild
On the banks of the river on a well-beaten path
It's funny how those memories they last

Like strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love, oh bittersweet
The green on the vine
Like strawberry wine

I still remember 
When thirty was old
My biggest fear was September 
When he had to go
A few cards and letters and one long distance call
We drifted away like the leaves in the fall
But year after year I come back to this place
Just to remember the taste

Of strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love, oh bittersweet
The green on the vine
Like strawberry wine

The fields have grown over now
Years since they've seen a plow
There's nothing time hasn't touched
Is it really him or the loss of my innocence
I've been missing so much
Yeah

Strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love, oh bittersweet
And green on the vine

And seventeen

And held your hand
Should've gave you all my hours

Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance

But she's dancing with another man

My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made, ohh…
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes

I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party

I heard that your dreams came true.
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you.

Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light.

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it.
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me it isn't over.

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me, I beg
I'll remember you said,
""Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead,
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead""

You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised
In a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it.
I'd hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me it isn't over.

No worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes
They are memories made.
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

You committed, I'm your crime

You got your finger on the trigger, but your trigger finger's mine

Silver dollar, golden flame
Dirty water, poison rain
Perfect murder, take your aim
I don't belong to anyone, but everybody knows my name

By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did

Copycat trying to cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat trying to cop my glamour
Why so sad bunny? Can't have mine?

Call me calloused, call me cold
You're italic, I'm in bold
Call me cocky, watch your tone
You better love me, 'cause you're just a clone

Hate to be the one that told you so

What happened to her plan?

She was gonna be an actress
She was gonna be a star
She was gonna shake her ass
On the hood of Whitesnake's car
Her yellow SUV is now the enemy
Looks at her average life
And nothing has been alright

She's seen all the classics
She knows every line
Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink
Even Saint Elmo's Fire
She rocked out to Wham
Not a big Limp Bizkit fan
Thought she'd get a hand
On a member of Duran Duran

Where's the mini-skirt made of snake skin
And who's the other guy that's singing in Van Halen
When did reality become T.V.
Whatever happened to sitcoms, game shows

And when did Ozzy become an actor?

I thought it was over
Aw that's just great

The whole damn world is just as obsessed
With who's the best dressed and who's having sex
Who's got the money, who gets the honeys
Who's kinda cute and who's just a mess
And you still don't have the right look
And you don't have the right friends
Nothing changes but the faces, the names, and the trends
High school never ends

You'll never guess what Jessica did
How did Mary Kate lose all that weight
And Katie had a baby so I guess Tom's straight
And the only thing that matters
Is climbing up that social ladder
Still care about your hair and the car you drive
Doesn't matter if you're sixteen or thirty-five

Reese Witherspoon,
She's the prom queen
Bill Gates,
Captain of the chess team
Jack Black, the clown
Brad Pitt, the quarterback

I want my money back

Who's throwing up before they digest

No one really knows if she's drunk or if she's stoned, but she's
Comin' back to my place tonight!

[Chorus:]
She likes to shake her ass she grinds it to the beat
She likes to pull my hair when I make her grind her teeth
I like to strip her down she's naughty to the end
You know what she is, no doubt about it
She's a bad, bad girlfriend!

Red thong, Party's on, Love this song, sing along.
Come together, leave alone, see you later back at home
No one really knows if she's drunk or is she's stoned
But she's coming back to my place tonight. I say
No one really knows just how far she's gonna go,
But I'm gonna find out later tonight

[Chorus]

Doesn't take her long to make things right.
But does it make her wrong to
Have the time of her life. the time of her life
My girlfriend's a dick magnet My girlfriend's gotta have it

She's a gold digger now you figure out it's over, pull the trigger.
Futures finished, there it went, savings gone,
The money spent

I look around and all I see is, no good, bad and ugly,
Man she's hot and fixed to be, the future
Ex-Miss Connolly!

[Chorus]

She's a bad, bad girlfriend.
She's a bad, bad girlfriend.

Ain't No Rest for the Wicked - Cage the Elephant,medium,pop,happy,2000s,"(He was a)
(You know it)
(He was a)

I was walkin' down the street
When out the corner of my eye
I saw a pretty little thing approaching me
She said, ""I never seen a man
Who looked so all alone
Oh, could you use a little company?

And if you pay the right price
Your evening will be nice
And you can go and send me on my way""
I said, ""You're such a sweet young thing
Why you do this to yourself?""
She looked at me and this is what she said

""Oh, there ain't no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
I got bills to pay
I got mouths to feed
And ain't nothing in this world for free
Oh no, I can't slow down
I can't hold back
Though you know I wish I could
Oh, no, there ain't no rest for the wicked
Until we close our eyes for good""

Not even 15 minutes later
I'm still walkin' down the street
When I saw the shadow of a man creep out of sight
And then he swept up from behind
He put a gun up to my head
He made it clear he wasn't lookin' for a fight

He said, ""Give me all you got
I want your money not your life
But if you try to make a move I won't think twice""
I told him, ""You can have my cash
But first you know I gotta ask
What made you wanna live this kind of life?""
He said

""There ain't no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
I got bills to pay
I got mouths to feed
And ain't nothing in this world for free
No, I can't slow down
I can't hold back
Though you know I wish I could
Oh, no, there ain't no rest for the wicked
Until we close our eyes for good""

Well, now a couple hours passed
And I was sitting in my house
The day was winding down and coming to an end
So I turned to the TV
And flipped it over to the news
And what I saw I almost couldn't comprehend

I saw a preacher man in cuffs
He'd taken money from the church
He'd stuffed his bank account with righteous dollar bills
But even still I can't say much
Because I know we're all the same
Oh, yes we all seek out to satisfy those thrills

You know there ain't no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
We got bills to pay
We got mouths to feed
And ain't nothing in this world for free
No we can't slow down
We can't hold back
Though you know we wish we could
No there ain't no rest for the wicked
Until we close our eyes for good

Nine In the Afternoon - Panic! At the Disco,medium,pop,happy,2000s,"Back to the street where we began

My Band - D12,fast,hip-hop/rap,happy,2000s,"I don't know dude
I think everybody's all jealous and shit 'cause I'm like the lead singer of a band dude
And I think everyone's got a fucking problem with me dude
And they need to take it up with me after the show
Because

These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

[Eminem:]
So I get off stage right drop the mic
Walk up to these hot chicks and I'm all like
""What's up, ladies? My name's Slim Shady
I'm the lead singer in D12 baby""
They're all like ""Oh my god it's him""
""Becky oh my fuckin' god it's Eminem""
""I swear to fucking god dude you fucking rock""
""Please Marshall please let me suck your cock""
And by now the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my acapellas
All the chicks start yellin', all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirts and their panties on stage
So like every single night they pick a fight with me
But when we fight it's kinda like sibling rivalry
'Cause they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude I just think you're tryna steal the light from me
Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
'Cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife to be
This rock star shit, it's the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me because

These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands

ADAT? How come we don't rap on Pro Tools?
Smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in a van and he in a tour bus
You don't want my autograph, you's a liar
And no, I'm Swift (oh I thought you were Kuniva)
What the hell is wrong with our dressing room
'Cause our shit is looking smaller than a decimal
See I know how to rap, it's simple but
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book
So I'm more intact, tryna get on the map
Doin' jumping jacks while get whipped on my back

[Kuniva and Kon Artis:]
Look at Em little punk ass thinkin' he the shit
Yeah I know man by himself taking all the flicks
Hey I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue
([Em:] No, I had an interview, not you two)
You gon' be late for soundcheck
I ain't gonna soundcheck
But our mics are screwed up and his always sound best
You know what man I'mma say something
Hey yo Em
([Em:] You got something to say?!)
Man no
I thought you was about to tell him off, man, what's up?
Man I'mma tell him when I feel like it, man shut up
And you ain't even back me up when we supposed to be crew
When I was bout to talk right after you
Aw, man, whatever
I swear, I swear man

They say the lead singers rock, but the group does not
Went from sold out arenas to amusement parks
I'm gon' let the world know that Proof is hot
I should cut his mic off when the music starts
Hey yo what's... Ready to snap on a dumbass fan
Every time I hear, ""Hey dude I love your band.""
We ain't a band bitch, we don't play instruments
So why he get 90 and we only get 10 percent
And these guys acting funny every area code
([Em:] Proof carry my bag)
Bitch carry your own
Can't make it to the stage, security in my way
(Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?!)

[Bizarre:]
God damn it I'm sick of this group
Time for me to go solo and make some loot
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps
'Til Kon Artis slipped me some crack
""Lose Yourself"" video I was in the back
""Superman"" video I was in the back
For the media, I got some suggestions
Fuck Marshall, ask us the questions
Like ""Who's D12? How we get started.""
(But what about Eminem?)
Bitch are you retarded?
Anyway I'm the popularest guy in the group
Big ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute (hey sexy)
50 told me to do sit-ups to get buff
Did two and a half and couldn't get up
Fuck D12, I'm outta this band
I'm 'bout to start a group with The Real Roxanne

Girl why can't you see you're the only one for me
And it just tears my ass apart to know that you don't know my name

I'm the lead singer of my band, my salsa
Makes all the pretty girls want to dance
My salsa, well, look out for my next single, it's called ""My Salsa""

But when that show ends, she all on my skin lotion
Slow motions, roller coasting like back, forth, hold it (Hold it [x4])
She pose like it's for posters and I poke like I'm supposed to
Take this photo if you for me, she said don't you ever show this
I'm too loyal and too focused, to be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this, she rejoiced it
Said your words get me open, so I closed it
Where your clothes is, I'm only loving for the moment

And I'm born rich, life ain't fair (silver spoon coon, ho)
Ain't nobody sicker and my Fisker ""vroom, vroom, "" ho
Ain't nobody
Fiskers don't make noise when they start up, just so you know
Top of the Hold 'em totem, rich forever, a million was not the quota
My father owned half of MoMA and did it with no diploma
Year off, got no rules, tripping off of them toadstools
More green than my Whole Foods and I'm too fly, Jeff Goldblum
Got a glass house in the Palisades, that a-k-a
White hood, white hood, (okay-kay-kay)
Furniture custom, you shop at IKEA
So Maserati, you whipping a Kia
Spending this money, it's longer than Nia
Live like a Coppola, me and Sofia
Waking up broke, man, wouldn't wanna be ya
Friends with the dope man, help a nigga re-up
Bring a girlfriend, man, trouble when I see her
""Err-err-err-err"": onomatopoeia, oh, I got my cool on! (tailormade)
I'm winning so they had to dump the Gatorade
And I don't give a fuck about my family name

The Real Slim Shady - Eminem,fast,hip-hop/rap,happy,2000s,"[Eminem]
May I have your attention please?
May I have your attention please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here..

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam and Tommy just burst in the door
And started whooping her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwing her over furniture (Ah!)
It's the return of the... ""Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding,
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said... nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement! (Ha-ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
[*vocal turntable: chigga chigga chigga*]
""Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walking around grabbing his you-know-what
Flipping the you-know-who."" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though!""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse, than what's going on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
""We ain't nothing but mammals.."" Well, some of us cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes [SLURP]
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
[*EWWW!*] But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes

[Chorus – Eminem (repeat 2x):]
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up,
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Eminem]
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records;
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""
Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can, sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Yo Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch, put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee!""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD [AHHH!]
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you [bzzzt]
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me; who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
It just might be the next best thing but not quite me!

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
I'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only giving you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your living room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it
In front of y'all and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it [*ERR*] I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums
It's funny; 'cause at the rate I'm going when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurses asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spitting on your onion rings
[*HACH*] Or in the parking lot, circling
Screaming ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So, will the real Shady please stand up?
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

[Chorus 4X]

[Eminem]

Than to be fuckin' with you, little stupid ass

Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

I heard you got a new man, I see you takin' a pic
Then you post it up, thinkin' that it's makin' me sick
I see you callin', I be makin' it quick
I'ma answer that shit like, ""I don't fuck with you.""
Bitch, I got no feelings to go
I swear I had it up to here, I got no ceilings to go
I mean, for real, fuck how you feel
Fuck your two cents if it ain't goin' towards the bill
Yeah, and every day I wake up celebratin' shit
Why? ‘Cause I just dodged a bullet from a crazy bitch
I stuck to my guns, that's what made me rich
That's what put me on, that's what got me here
That's what made me this
And everything that I do is my first name (B-I-G)
These hoes chase bread, aw damn, she got a bird brain
Ain't nothin' but trill in me, aw man, silly me
I just bought a crib, three stories; that bitch a trilogy
And you know I'm rollin' weed that's fuckin' up the ozone
I got a bitch that text me she ain't got no clothes on
And then another one text, then your ass next
And I'ma text your ass back, like…

I don't fuck with you
You little stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
You little, you little dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do

I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

[E-40:]
Got a million things on my mind, executive deals online
Limited amount of time, chasin' these dollar signs
And you ain't on your grind
You liable to find me up in the MGM casino in the D
Fuckin' off fetti I could've put on property
From the Bay to the Murder Mitten
My niggas put murder missions
She choosin', that's her decision, free my niggas in prison
On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit
For a pimp but make a nigga hella rich
Got a blunt in my dental, blowin' hemp in a rental
On my way to Sacramento, late night; Arsenio
I'm never sentimental, go hard or go homeless
Barely Harley, I'm chromeless, you might end up domeless
I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me
I'll make a bitch stand outside forever, like the Statue of Liberty
Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South
I raise my styrofoam up, and pour some drink in my mouth
Why you always coming around with bad news?
Say you want me to win, but hope I lose
Askin' if I rock with other niggas in the crew
But them niggas cool, it's just that…

I got a new whip that I gotta thank the lot for
Yeah, I got a lot but want a lot more
Yeah, we in the buildin', but I'm tryna take it to the top floor
I swear I hear some new bullshit every day I'm wakin' up
It seems like nowadays everybody breakin' up
That shit can break you down if you lose a good girl
I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up
I guess drama makes for the best content
Everything got a bad side, even a conscience
Now you're drinkin' 'til you're unconscious
Feel me when you get a fine bitch
Just don't forget to read the fine print
Life got me meditatin' like I'm in the Himalayas
Keep it G with the L lit on me like the elevator
Yeah, I know that karma's too real
So I hope you doin' cool, but still…

The Motto (feat. Lil Wayne) - Drake,medium,hip-hop/rap,happy,2010s,"[Drake:]
I’m the fucking man, you don’t get it, do ya?
Type of money everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City bitch
Some Spanish girls love me like I’m Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I’m out in Miami too
Clubbing hard, fuckin’ women ain’t much to do
Wrist blang, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain’t shit changed
How you feel? How you feel? How you feel?
Twenty five sittin’ on 25 mil uh
I’m in the building and I’m feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, I’mma do it for the Bay, okay
Getting paid well holla whenever that stop
My team good, we don’t really need a mascot
Tell Tune, “Light one, pass it like a relay”
YMCMB you niggas more YMCA
Me, Freddie, Marley Marl at the cribbo
Shout goes out to Niko, Jay and Chubbs, shout to Gibo
We got Santa Margarita by the liter
She know even if I'm fucking with her, I don’t really need her
Ah, that’s how you feel man?
That’s really how you feel?
Cause the pimpin’ ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won’t
Then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal,
Real nigga what's up?

[Drake - Chorus:]
Now she want a photo

You only live once ‒ that’s the motto nigga YOLO
And we 'bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin’ on the bench, nigga we don’t really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can’t see 'em 'cause the money in the way
Real nigga what's up?

[Lil Wayne:]
One time, fuck one time
I’m calling niggas out like the umpire
Seven grams in the blunt
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt
It’s Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That’s my MO add a B to that shit
I’m fucked up, torn down
I’m twisted, door knob
Talk stupid, off with your head!
Nigga money talks and Mr Ed! YEAH!
I’m so Young Money got a drum on the gun
Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain’t sweet like sugar
Ain’t shit sweet niggas on the street like hookers
I tongue kiss her other tongue
Skeet skeet skeet: water gun
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt! Tunechi!

I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin' 'em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain't poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
Now I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This shit gon' be different, I set my intentions

I'm little bro and big bro all at once
Just left the lab with young 21 Savage
I'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch
Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak
Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
I wish that he had more guidance, for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail

[Intro]
So where’s your saviour tonight?
As angels fall from the sky
His idle hands let me inside
Where I cannot be crucified

[Verse 1]
Forgive me father, have I sinned?
Who gives a fuck how long it’s been
Just let this holy war begin
I am the darkness deep within
The devil in her daughter’s skin
And I’ll be there ’til the bitter end
Don’t raise your claws to me
In the name of God, I command you to flee
Relentlessly ‘cause we believe
By the power of Christ we will set her free

[Chorus]
So where’s your Savior tonight?
As angels fall from the sky
His idle hands let me inside
Where I cannot be crucified
You spent your life in His light
Still, faith can’t save you tonight
Yet evil stands the test of time
I cannot be crucified


[Verse 2]
So round and round I spin my head
Circulate the blood that I have shed
Pass the cup and drink from me instead
Savour the taste and quench your thirst
With the communion of the cursed
Get on your knees and prove your worth
Don’t raise your filth to me
I know you’re in there, Regan
Just continue to breathe
I will cast him out, his grip is weakening
Cast him out, this is his day of reckoning
Through the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost
I will lure this parasite from its wholesome host
Eternally, my last decree
If a soul must be taken I demand you take me

[Chorus]
So where’s your Savior tonight?
As angels fall from the sky
His idle hands let me inside
Where I cannot be crucified
You spent your life in His light
Still, faith can’t save you tonight
Yet evil stands the test of time
I cannot be crucified

Now I lay her down to sleep
Her soul is mine, and mine to keep
If she dies before she wakes, I’ll find another soul to take
If she dies before she wakes
I’ll find another soul to take

You can't run, you can't hide
I'll be there when you close your eyes at night

The doctor says I'm headed for destruction
My time is wearing thin...

I'm like a time bomb ticking in your head
Paranoia clouding your judgement

I'm still in your head",any
Nightmare - Avenged Sevenfold,medium,metal,angry,2010s,"[Intro]
Nightmare!
Now your nightmare comes to life

[Verse 1]
Dragged ya down below, down to the devil's show
To be his guest forever (Peace of mind is less than never)
Hate to twist your mind, but God ain't on your side
An old acquaintance severed (Burn the world your last endeavor)
Flesh is burning, you can smell it in the air
'Cause men like you have such an easy soul to steal (steal)
So stand in line while they ink numbers in your head
You're now a slave until the end of time here
Nothing stops the madness turning, haunting, yearning pull the trigger

[Chorus]
You should have known the price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
Oooooooh, it's your fucking nightmare
While your nightmare comes to life

[Verse 2]
Can't wake up in sweat, 'cause it ain't over yet
Still dancing with your demons (Victim of your own creation)
Beyond the will to fight, where all that's wrong is right
Where hate don't need a reason (Loathing self-assassination)
You've been lied to just to rape you of your sight
And now they have the nerve to tell you how to feel (feel)
So sedated as they medicate your brain
And while you slowly go insane they tell you:
""Given with the best intentions, help you with your complications""


[Chorus 2]
You should have known the price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
No one to call, everybody to fear
Your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah
Oooooooh, it's your fucking nightmare
HA! HA! HA! HA!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Fight (Fight!), not to fail (fail!), not to fall (fall!)
Or you'll end up like the others
Die (Die!), die again (die!), drenched in sin (sin!)
With no respect for another
OH!
Down(Down!), feel the fire(fire!), feel the hate(hate!)
Your pain is what we desire
Lost (Lost!), hit the wall (wall!), watch you crawl (crawl!)
Such a replaceable liar

[Bridge]
And I know you hear their voices (Calling from above)
And I know they may seem real (These signals of love)
But our life's made up of choices (Some without appeal)
They took for granted your soul
And it's ours now to steal
As your nightmare comes to life


[Chorus 2]
You should have known the price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
No one to call, everybody to fear
Your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah
Oooooooh, it's your fucking nightmar",any
Afterlife - Avenged Sevenfold,medium,metal,angry,2000s,"[Verse 1]
Like walking into a dream, so unlike what you've seen
So unsure but it seems, 'cause we've been waiting for you
Fallen into this place, just giving you a small taste
Of your afterlife here so stay, you'll be back here soon anyway
I see a distant light, but girl, this can't be right
Such a surreal place to see, so how did this come to be?
Arrived too early

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And when I think of all the places I just don't belong
I've come to grips with life and realize this is going too far

[Chorus 1]
I don't belong here, we gotta move on, dear
Escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time I'm right to move on and on
Far away from here

[Verse 2]
A place of hope and no pain, perfect skies with no rain
Can leave this place but refrain, 'cause we've been waiting for you
Fallen into this place, just giving you a small taste
Of your afterlife here so stay, you'll be back here soon anyway
This piece on Earth's not right (with my back against the wall)
No pain or sign of time (I'm much too young to fall)
So out of place, don't wanna stay, I feel wrong and that's my sign
I've made up my mind


[Pre-Chorus 2]
Give me your hand but realize I just wanna say goodbye
Please understand I have to leave and carry on my own life

[Chorus 2]
I don't belong here, we gotta move on, dear
Escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time I'm right to move on and on
Far away from here
Got nothing against you and surely I'll miss you
This place full of peace and light
And I'd hope you might take me back inside
When the time is right

[Bridge: M. Shadows & The Rev]
Loved ones back home all crying
'Cause they’re already missing me
I pray by the grace of God
That there’s somebody listening
Give me a chance to be that person I wanna be
(I am unbroken, I’m choking on this ecstasy)
Oh, Lord, I’ll try so hard, but you gotta let go of me
(Unbreak me, unchain me, I need another chance to live!)

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus 2]
I don't belong here, we gotta move on dear
Escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time I'm right to move on and on
Far away from here
Got nothing against you and surely I'll miss you
This place full of peace and light, and I'd hope you might
Take me back inside when the time is righ",any
Snuff - Slipnot,slow,metal,sad,2000s,"[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Bury all your secrets in my skin
Come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins
The air around me still feels like a cage
And love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again

[Chorus 1]
So if you love me, let me go
And run away before I know
My heart is just too dark to care
I can't destroy what isn't there
Deliver me into my fate
If I'm alone I cannot hate
I don't deserve to have you
Ooh my smile was taken long ago
If I can change I hope I never know

[Verse 2]
I still press your letters to my lips
And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
I couldn't face a life without your light (Without your light)
But all of that was ripped apart when you refused to fight

[Chorus 2]
So save your breath, I will not hear
I think I made it very clear
You couldn't hate enough to love
Is that supposed to be enough?
I only wish you weren't my friend
Then I could hurt you in the end
I never claimed to be a saint
Ooh my own was banished long ago
It took the death of hope to let you go


[Guitar solo]

Oh, oh

[Chorus 3]
So break yourself against my stones
And spit your pity in my soul
You never needed any help
You sold me out to save yourself
And I won't listen to your shame
You ran away, you're all the same
Angels lie to keep control
Ooh my love was punished long ago
If you still care, don't ever let me know
If you still care, don't ever let me know

The Devil in I - Slipnot,medium,metal,angry,2010s,"[Verse 1]
Undo these chains, my friend, I'll show you the rage I've hidden
Perish the sacrament, swallow but nothing's forgiven
You and I can't decide which of us was taken for granted
Make amends, some of us are destined to be outlived

[Chorus]
Step inside, see the Devil in I
Too many times we've let it come to this
Step inside, see the Devil in I
You'll realize I'm not your Devil anymore

[Verse 2]
Under the words of men, something is tempting the father
Where is your will, my friend? Insatiates never even bother
You and I, wrong or right, traded a lie for the leverage
In between the lens in light, you're not what you seem

[Chorus]
Step inside, see the Devil in I
Too many times we've let it come to this
Step inside, see the Devil in I
You'll realize I'm not your Devil
I'm not your Devil anymore

[Bridge]
Your station is abandoned
Fooled you 'cause I know what you've done
Sensation, deprivation
You should've burned when you turned on everyone


[Chorus]
So step inside, see the Devil in I
Too many times we've let it come to this
Step inside, see the Devil in I
I know you'll find your answers in the end
Step inside, see the Devil in I
You'll realize I'm not your Devil anymore

[Outro]
So step inside
Step inside
See the devil in I
See the devil in I",any
Jekyll and Hyde - Five Finger Death Punch,medium,metal,angry,2010s,"[Verse 1]
There's just so much God damned weight on my shoulders
All I'm trying to do is live my motherfucking life
Supposed to be happy, but I'm only getting colder
Wear a smile on my face, but there's a demon inside
There's just so much God damned weight on my shoulders
All I'm trying to do is live my motherfucking life
Supposed to be happy, but I'm only getting colder
Wear a smile on my face, but there's a demon inside

There's just so much God damned weight on your shoulders
That you can't just live your motherfucking life
The story's getting old and my heart is getting colder
I just wanna be Jekyll, but I'm always fighting Hyde
You've got rocks in your head, I can hear them rolling 'round
You can say that you're above it, but you're always falling down
Is there a method to your madness? Is it all about pride?
Everyone I know, they've got a demon inside

If I ever were to change, would this song remain the same?

Wear a smile on my face, but there's a demon inside
